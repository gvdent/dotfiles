These are my configuration files which I find usefull to have. These are provided as is, feel free to use them, but
expect no support, or even expect them to work for you.

Contents:
screenrc  - configuration for screen
vimrc     - configuration for vim
aliases   - aliases, for sourcing in bash_aliases
gitconfig - config for git. ln this to .gitconfig in the homedir since git doesn't allow sourcing.

place_in_homedir/.* configuration files as they are to be read by the programs. Expect the dotfiles dir to be present
